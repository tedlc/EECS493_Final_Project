This Project is a client-side dynamic HTML APP.
It can be seen as a dashboard for multi-purposes. And the main function is to help users to track their tasks as well as their body health(Daily water drinking. etc.)

The back end will help users to prioritize their tasks. The to-do list is ranked based on DDL.
We used local storage to store the user data. So each time user opens it, they will see previous unfinished things.
